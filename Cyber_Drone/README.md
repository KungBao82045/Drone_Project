# About this project
Control your drone using voice commands! With the implementation of OpenAI API, your drone can now communicate through natural language (english) instead of following hardcoded response.
As for 09/04/25, this is my latest project.

# Note
Because you need to connect your drone through WiFi, as well as connecting to the internet to fetch API endpoint, you need a WiFi adapter. With a WiFi adapter, you can connect your laptop to the internet, and a wifi adapter to your drone. 

You need your own OpenAI subscription token in Azure before executing a Python script located in "Cyber_Drone/voiceCommand/ai_voiceCommands.py"
