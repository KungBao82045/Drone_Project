# About this project
Control your drone using voice commands! With the implementation of OpenAI API, your drone can now communicate through natural language (english).
As for 09/04/25, this is my latest project.

# Note
Because you need to connect your drone through WiFi, as well as connecting to the internet to fetch API endpoint, you need a WiFi adapter. With a WiFi adapter, you can connect your laptop to the internet, and a wifi adapter to your drone.
