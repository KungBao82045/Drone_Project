# About this project
Control your drone using voice commands! With the implementation of OpenAI API, your drone can now communicate through natural language (english) instead of following hardcoded response.
As for 09/04/25, this is my latest project.

# Note
Because you need to connect your drone through WiFi, as well as connecting to the internet and fetch the API endpoint, you need an extra WiFi adapter to connect your drone and the internet at the same time. 

You need your own OpenAI subscription token in Azure before executing a Python script located in "Cyber_Drone/voiceCommand/ai_voiceCommands.py"
